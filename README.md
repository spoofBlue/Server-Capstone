Quick Project Summary:
This is my project site called Harvest United.  The goal of the site is to connect restaurants and markets that naturally hold excess food, with non-profit organizations (food shelters, soup kitchens) for a food exchange.

My Purpose:
This project was created after my Thinkful Unit on server-side programming; therefore, my project focused on server routing, database management, and server testing.

How the site works:
User can either create "donator" or "receiver" entries.  
- Restaurants, diners, super markets, etc would qualify as food donators.  When they create a donator entry, they provide their location, a brief note on what their business does, and what food items they're able to donate. 
- Homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and other non-profit organizations would qualify as food receivers.  When they create a receiver entry, they provide their location, a brief note on what their organization does, and what quantity of food they would ideally receive.
- Whether they're a donator or receiver, they also present their contact information (name, e-mail, phone number) for connection.
- Users can search for either donator or receiver entries near their zipcode, which the user can access for contact information.
